Abstract: The [iLEAP Technical Specifications](https://sine-fdn.github.io/ileap-extension/specs/) outline the the semantics for logistics emissions data exchange, thereby promoting a seamless exchange of logistics emissions data. They were conceived as an extension to the [PACT Data Model and Data Exchange Protocol](https://wbcsd.github.io/data-exchange-protocol/v2/), thereby levereging its network effects. This document provides answers to frequently asked questions about the iLEAP Technical Specifications, including their integration with the PACT Tech Specs.

# On Selecting the PACT Tech Specs as a Foundation for iLEAP # {#on-selecting-pact}

This section explains the choice made by SINE and the Smart Freight Centre to base the work of
iLEAP on some of the technical work of the [WBCSD PACT
Project](https://www.carbon-transparency.org/), in particular the [PACT Technical
Specifications](https://wbcsd.github.io/data-exchange-protocol/v2/).

## What is PACT? ## {#what-is-pact}

PACT (Partnership for Carbon Transparency) is a WBCSD-led project that aims to enable emissions
transparency at the product and service level. To achieve this, PACT has both a methodological focus
("how to calculate the carbon footprints of products and services") and a technological focus ("how
to make such data available in a seamless and automated way").

What sets PACT apart from other initiatives is its industry-agnostic and global focus. This means
that the methodological and technological approaches are designed to be used on a global scale and
by companies of different sizes, profiles, and specializations.

## What are the PACT Tech Specs? ## {#what-are-pact-tech-specs}

The PACT Technical Specifications (or simply "PACT Tech Specs") are an interoperability
quasi-standard to enable the seamless (and interoperable) exchange of carbon footprint data, often
referred to as Product Carbon Footprints (PCFs).

To achieve interoperability, the PACT Tech Specs consist of a data model and a data exchange
protocol. The data model is designed to be extensible, i.e., it is possible to add additional
information for further transparency when receiving emissions data.

This feature of the PACT Tech Specs is specifically designed to enable the exchange of
industry-specific data, such as logistics emissions data.

### Technical details of the PACT Tech Specs ### {#pact-tech-specs-details}

On a technical level, the PACT data exchange protocol is a minimal HTTP REST API that allows one
party to make carbon emissions data available to another party, as well as to asynchronously request
specific data to be made available.

When 2 parties (the party that "owns" the emissions data, plus the party that wants to retrieve the
data) implement the PACT Tech Specs, they can seamlessly and fully automatically exchange
information between **independent** software solutions and systems - i.e. achieve interoperability
at a technical level.

## How do the iLEAP Tech Specs relate to the PACT Tech Specs? ## {#ileap-pact-relation}

In addition to the PACT Tech Specs, the iLEAP Tech Specs define what is necessary to achieve
**logistics** emissions transparency.

For this purpose, the iLEAP Tech Specs define a data model that is aligned and based on the
principles of ISO14083 and the [GLEC Framework
v3](https://smart-freight-centre-media.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/GLEC_FRAMEWORK_v3_UPDATED_12_10.pdf).

On a very technical and software implementation level, the iLEAP data model is designed as a
so-called "Data Model Extension" to the PACT data model.

This means that the logistic emissions data being exchanged are treated as a Product Carbon
Footprint (a "logistics product" / logistics service footprint) in order to achieve interoperability
with any system implementing the PACT Tech Specs.

The iLEAP Tech Specs provide further
[guidance](https://sine-fdn.github.io/ileap-extension/#pcf-mapping) on how to integrate the iLEAP
data into the PACT data model.

## Why did iLEAP choose PACT Tech Specs as a protocol and foundation? ## {#why-choose-pact}

Carbon emissions transparency, especially at Scope 3, is a global challenge. Without
interoperability and global adoption of 1 (or at least very very few) approaches, the cost and
effort to achieve carbon transparency based on actual and primary data, will be significantly
higher.

By adopting PACT's approaches and technical foundations, iLEAP is contributing to the realization of
an  "Internet of Emissions Data" through interoperability. Several synergies will be achieved:

1. **the effort to add iLEAP support to existing systems and implementations is significantly
    reduced**, increasing the likelihood that they will also implement the iLEAP Tech Specs;
2. **iLEAP contributes to achieving a single Internet of Emissions Data,** avoiding further
    fragmentation of what should be a global data ecosystem;
3. Tool providers and their customers and users will benefit from synergistic network effects:
    implementers of the iLEAP Tech Specs will be interoperable with a growing ecosystem of solution
    providers from day one - that's 25+ solutions in the [PACT
    ecosystem](https://www.carbon-transparency.org/network) alone as of today.

In this sense, iLEAP can potentially benefit from the network effects of PACT, increasing the
chances of global adoption for both iLEAP and PACT at the same time.

Furthermore, this option is much more attractive for shippers, as they can use the same software to
collect the emissions data for both the products and their shipment.

But using PACT's data model also has advantages for iLEAP. For example, PACT already implements
verification and accreditation related data in its data model. Since the logistics emissions will be
embedded in this data model, iLEAP will be able to re-use the work instead of developing a different
and non-interoperable approach.
