Abstract: This document specifies the data exchange profile for the SFC iLEAP project which is based on the Pathfinder Technical Specifications and supports the integration of Logistics Emissions Data Exchange into the Patfhinder Network. By implementing this specification, logistics actors can exchange logistics emission data. Likewise, shippers can request logistics emission data from their logistics service providers while also integrating the emission values at a per-product level.

# Introduction # {#introduction}

Issue: this section needs rewording.

- Logistics emissions account for a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions.
- This document specifies a data model and data transactions necessary for the interoperable exchange of primary logistics emissions data
- The data model [[#data-model]] and the foundational data transactions ([[#txns]]) build upon the [[!GLEC]] Framework, the Pathfinder Framework, and the Pathfinder Technical Specifications.
- By implementing this specification, logistics actors can exchange logistics emission data at the level of individual consignments / [=TCEs=], at the level of [=TOCs=] and [=HOCs=].
- This technical specification is based on the [[!GLEC]] Framework, the related [[!ISO14083|ISO 14083]], and the Data Exchange Project of [=SFC=].


Issue: Check spelling and definition of units (i.e. is it `kilometers` or `kilometre` etc.)!

## Out of Scope ## {#out-of-scope}

This specifcation shall does not cover the following topics or aspects as they are covered elsewhere or declared as out of scope of this specification:

1. Methodology for the exact calculation of Logistics-related emissions which is explained in the GLEC Framework and specified in [[!ISO14083|ISO 14083]]
2. Black Carbon (Accounting)
3. How to exactly capture necessary primary activity data for the calculation of [=HOCs=] or [=TOCs=] (i.e. through telematics systems, TMS, or others)
4. Pilot decentralized data exchange following data space governance principles
5. How to establish contractual obligations between parties for the provision of data
6. How to perform data audits and verification

Issue: The GLEC Framework reference at the end of this file needs an update

Issue: V/G sync this section with the slidedeck's "out of scope" section

Issue: add `Decimal` data type definition

# Business Cases # {#business-cases}

Note: Non-normative section

This specification shall serve the general need of businesses for end-to-end Carbon Accounting and Reporting, conforming with the [[!GLEC]] Framework and ISO 14083.

Given the nature of the logistics industry, and in order to reduce costs overall,
logistics emissions transparency is only possible if all the parties involved
are able to exchange emissions data in an interoperable way.

To achieve this, this specification is guided by a set of defining business cases.
They are the foundation to define a set of basic data transactions which allow for
the decentralized data exchange among peers, for instance different kinds of [=logistic actors=]
(such as [=LSPs=], [=Carriers=], or [=Hub Operators=]) or the exchange of data between a [=logistic actor=] and a [=shipper=].

The following business cases shall be supported by this specification:

: Business Case #a1
::
    a [=Carrier=] shares transport activity data (such as the `ton kilometers` related to a consignment)
    with an [=LSP=] to enable e.g. an LSP or a [=Tool Provider=] to calculate the related emissions

: Business Case #2
::
    A [=shipper=] wants to give logistics emissions transparency to its customers
    by disclosing logistics emissions as part of a [=PCF=].
    This is enabled through the usage of the Pathfinder Technical Specification
    and disclosing through so-called Data Model Extensions based on the iLEAP
    Data Model ([[#data-model]]) .

    Issue: add a reference to the Pathfinder Data Model Extensions specification

: <dfn>Business Case #3</dfn>
::
    An [=LSP=] wants to collect logistics intensity information from its
    contractors so that it can calculate emissions at so-called
    [=TCE=]-level.
    For this, the LSP performs data transactions ([[#txn2]]) to collect emission
    intensities ([=HOCs=] or [=TOCs=]) from its contractors.


: Business Case #4
::
    A [=shipper=] wants to quantify the avoided emissions stemming from
    operational changes in their transport network. For this, the [=shipper=]
    procures the operational changes and compares the resulting logistics
    emissions with the emissions without the intervention.
    This is enabled through [[#txn1]].


## Potential additional Business Cases ## {#txns-appendix}

Issue: this section needs to be first discussed between SFC and SINE

: Business Case #a2
:: a [=Hub Operator=] shares activity data with an LSP to enable the LSP to calculate the emissions of a [=HOC=]


# Data Transactions # {#txns}

Issue: create and add transactions diagram to this section


A <dfn>data transaction</dfn> is the process of a data exchange between 2 or more parties as defined in this section.

Each data transaction is scoped by which party (a [=logistic actor=] or [=shipper=]) is interacting with a second party, and which kind of data is exchanged (see [[#data-model]]).

Data transactions are executed by [=host systems=] which implement this specification.

A single data transaction, or sometimes the consecutive execution of business transactions, enable 1 or more business cases (see [[#business-cases]]).


## Data Transaction 1: TCE Data Exchange ## {#txn1}


Issue: remove the "or more shipments" from this transaction.

This data transaction enables a [=logistic actor=] to exchange logistics emissions data with a [=shipper=] at the level of a single shipment.

For this, a [=logistic actor=] MUST

1. first calculate 1 or more ([=TCEs=]) in accordance with the [[!GLEC]] Framework and ISO 14083, and then
1. make the resulting [=TCEs=] available to the [=shipper=] through the Pathfinder Network API using the [=LSF=] data model (see [[#dt-lsf]]).

The [=shipper=] CAN then
1. collect [=TCEs=] from 1 or more [=logistic actors=] to construct
    the transport chain ([=TC=]). The shipper CAN then calculate the logistics emissions of the shipment
    in accordance with the [[!GLEC]] Framework and [[!ISO14083]].
1. access the logistics emissions data of the shipment from the [=logistic actor=]
    through the Action `ListFootprints` of the Pathfinder Network API
1. or if a [=logistic actor=] supports the Pathfinder Network Events API, a shipper CAN
    request the logistics emissions data for the shipments from the [=logistic actor=]
    through the Pathfinder Network Events API.


### Example ### {#txn1-example}

Issue: create example for this transaction, including data exchanged


## Data Transaction 2: TOC and HOC Data Exchange ## {#txn2}

This data transaction enables a [=logistic actor=] to make logistics emissions intensity data at the level of a [=TOC=] or [=HOC=] available to a another company.

For this, a [=logistic actor=] MUST

1. first calculate the emissions intensity of the [=HOC=] or [=TOC=] in accordance with the [[!GLEC]] Framework and ISO 14083, and then
1. make the resulting category emission intensity available through the Pathfinder Network API as a <{TOC}> or <{HOC}> (see [[#dt-toc]] and [[#dt-hoc]]).

Note:
    The details on how to define and to calculate [=TOCs=] and [=HOCs=] are specified in [[!ISO14083]]
    and guidance provided through the [[!GLEC]] Framework.
    Details of the calculation method are out of scope of this specification.

Note: This enables [=Business Case #3=].


## Data Transaction 3: Activity Data Exchange ## {#txn3}

Note:
      This data transaction is considered necessary by logistics parties.
      Especially for SMEs, lacking the capabilities to Report curated emissions data,
      the option to provide activity data to their customers should be given.

This data transaction enables a [=logistic actor=] to exchange [=Transport Activity Data=] with a another company.




# End-to-End Examples # {#examples}

Issue: create an end-to-end example combining Transction 1 and Transaction 2 to show how a shipper can gain transparency at the level of shipments and at the level of TCEs


# Data Model # {#data-model}

## Logistics Service Footprint ( <def>LSF</def> ) ## {#dt-lsf}

Issue: we need to find a better term! (candidate: shipment footprint)

- A logistics service footprint ([=LSF=]) contains the [=TCE=]-level logistics emissions
    relating to a single shipment identified by a [=shipment id=].
    These are all the transport or hub activities performed by a logistic actor
    to its customer, which could comprise the full TC, or part of it.
- The emissions disclosed MUST be calculated in accordance with the [[!GLEC]] Framework, by
    1. first applying the GLEC Framework to calculate the emissions of the [=TCEs=]
    1. then disclosing the footprint as specified below

Issue: this section needs additional refinement and specifications

### Data Attributes ### {#lsf-attributes}

A logistics service footprint ([=LSF=]) contains the following attributes (<dfn element>LSF</dfn>),
stored in the data model extension property `extensions` of the underlying `ProductFootprint`:

## Hub Operation Category ( <dfn element>HOC</dfn> ) ## {#dt-hoc}

Advisement: This section and data model requires significant input from the SFC Community

The Data Type <{HOC}> contains [=HOC=] data. It is referenced in a [=TCE=] through the <{TCE/hocId}> property.

[=HOCs=] are the building blocks for the calculation of a [=TCE=].

### Mapping to Pathfinder Data Model ### {#hoc-mapping}

## Transport Activity Data (<dfn element>TAD</dfn>) ## {#dt-tad}

<dfn>Transport Activity Data</dfn> contains [=transport activity data=]-level data relating to transport or
hub operations activities.

Transport Activity Data can be obtained from direct measurement
(see `primary data` definition of [[!ISO14083]]) or other measurements
(see `secondary data` definition of [[!ISO14083]]) such as modelled data
or default value.


### Data Attributes ### {#tad-attributes}

Note:
    the <{TAD}> data type is defined for the exchange of (primary) activity data for
    which no GHG emission or GHG entisities values have been calculated.

Properties of data type <{TAD}>:

Issue: this needs to be discussed with SFC and especially also Tool providers:
