# Introduction # {#introduction}

Issue: this section needs rewording.

- Logistics emissions account for a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions.
- This document specifies a data model and [=data transactions=] necessary for the interoperable exchange of primary logistics emissions data
- The data model [[#data-model]] and the foundational data transactions ([[#txns]]) build upon the [[!GLEC]] Framework, the Pathfinder Framework, and the Pathfinder Technical Specifications.
- By implementing this specification, different stakeholders of the logistics value chain can exchange data to enable logistics emissions calculation at the level of individual [=shipments=] ([=TCEs=]), at the level of so-called [=TOCs=], and [=HOCs=].
- This technical specification is based on the [[!GLEC]] Framework, the related [[!ISO14083|ISO 14083]], and the Data Exchange Project of [=SFC=].


Issue: Update number so that `Business Case #3` becomes `Business Case #1`

Issue: Check spelling and definition of units (i.e. is it `kilometers` or `kilometre` etc.)!

## Out of Scope ## {#out-of-scope}

This specifcation shall does not cover the following topics or aspects as they are covered elsewhere or declared as out of scope of this specification:

1. Methodology for the exact calculation of Logistics-related emissions which is explained in the GLEC Framework and specified in [[!ISO14083|ISO 14083]]
2. Black Carbon (Accounting)
3. How to exactly capture necessary primary activity data for the calculation of [=HOCs=] or [=TOCs=] (i.e. through telematics systems, TMS, or others)
4. Pilot decentralized data exchange following data space governance principles
5. How to establish contractual obligations between parties for the provision of data
6. How to perform data audits and verification

Issue: The GLEC Framework reference at the end of this file needs an update

Issue: V/G sync this section with the slidedeck's "out of scope" section

Issue: add `Decimal` data type definition

# Business Cases # {#business-cases}

Note: Non-normative section

This specification shall serve the general need of businesses for end-to-end Carbon
Accounting and Reporting, conforming with the [[!GLEC]] Framework and ISO 14083.

Given the nature of the logistics industry, and in order to reduce costs overall,
logistics emissions transparency is made possible if all the parties involved
are able to exchange emissions data in an interoperable way.

To achieve this, this specification is guided by a set of business cases.
They are the context from which supporting data transactions ([#txns]) are defined.

The following business cases shall be supported by this specification:

: <dfn>Business Case #3</dfn>
::
    An [=Transport Service Organizer=] wants to collect information from its
    contractors so that they can calculate emissions according to the GLEC Framework and ISO 14083.

    For this, the LSP performs data transactions ([[#txn2]]) to collect emission
    intensities ([=HOCs=] or [=TOCs=]) from its contractors.

: Business Case #a1
::
    a [=Transport Operator=] shares [=Transport Activity=] data with e.g an 
    [=Tranport Service Organizer=]. 

    For this, the [=Transport Operator=] collects Transaport Activity Data
    and makes it available through the Pathfinder API using a Pathfinder Data Model Extension
    as specified in [[#dt-tad]].

: Business Case #2
::
    A [=Transpor Service User=] wants to give logistics emissions transparency 
    to its customers by disclosing logistics emissions as part of a [=PCF=].
    This is enabled through the usage of the Pathfinder Technical Specification
    and disclosing through so-called Data Model Extensions based on the iLEAP
    Data Model ([[#data-model]]) .

    Issue: add a reference to the Pathfinder Data Model Extensions specification

: Business Case #4
::
    A [=shipper=] wants to quantify the avoided emissions stemming from
    operational changes in their transport network. For this, the [=shipper=]
    procures the operational changes and compares the resulting logistics
    emissions with the emissions without the intervention.
    This is enabled through [[#txn1]].


## Potential additional Business Cases ## {#txns-appendix}

Issue: this section needs to be first discussed between SFC and SINE

: Business Case #a2
:: a [=Hub Operator=] shares activity data with an LSP to enable the LSP to calculate the emissions of a [=HOC=]


# Data Transactions # {#txns}

Issue: create and add transactions diagram to this section


A <dfn>data transaction</dfn> is the process of a data exchange between 2 or more parties as defined in this section.

Each data transaction is scoped by which kind of party (such as [=Transport Operator=] or a [=Transport Service User=]) 
is interacting with a second party, and which kind of data is exchanged (see [[#data-model]]).

Data transactions are executed by [=host systems=] which implement this specification.

A single data transaction, or sometimes the consecutive execution of business transactions, enable 1 or more business cases (see [[#business-cases]]).


## Data Transaction 1: TCE Data Exchange ## {#txn1}

This data transaction enables a [=Transport Service User=] (such as a [=shipper=]) to receive <{TCE|TCEs}> from a 
[=Transport Operator=] or a [=Transport Service Organizer=] for a single [=shipment=].

For this, the [=Transport Operator=] or the [=Transport Service Organizer=] MUST

1. first calculate 1 or more TCEs in accordance with the [[!GLEC]] Framework and ISO 14083, and then
1. make the resulting <{LSF}> available to the [=Transport Service User=] through the Pathfinder 
    Network API (see [[#dt-lsf]]).

The [=Transport Service User=] CAN then use this transaction to collect the necessary of a Transport Chain ([=TC=]), by
1. collecting the <{TCE|TCEs}> from all the [=Transport Operators=] and the [=Transport Service Organizers=] related to the shipment
1. forming the [=TC=] from the collected TCEs
1. calculate the logistics emissions of the shipment in accordance with the [[!GLEC]] Framework and ISO 14083

Note: a Transport Service User can also be an [=LSP=].

### Example ### {#txn1-example}

Issue: create example for this transaction, including data exchanged


## Data Transaction 2: TOC Data Exchange ## {#txn2}

This data transaction enables [=Transport Operators=] and [=Transport Service Organizers=] 
to make logistics emissions intensity data at the level of 1 or more [=TOC=] .

For this, the [=Transport Operator=] or [=Transport Service Organizer=] MUST

1. first calculate 1 or more TOCs in accordance with the [[!GLEC]] Framework and ISO 14083, and then
1. make the resulting <{TOCs}> available through the Pathfinder Network API (see [[#dt-toc]]).

Note:
    The details on how to define and to calculate [=TOCs=] and [=HOCs=] are specified in [[!ISO14083]]
    and guidance provided through the [[!GLEC]] Framework.
    Details of the calculation method are out of scope of this specification.

Note: This enables [=Business Case #3=].


## Data Transaction 3: Transport Activity Data Exchange ## {#txn3}

Note:
      This data transaction is considered necessary by logistics parties.
      Especially for SMEs, lacking the capabilities to Report curated emissions data,
      the option to provide activity data to their customers should be given.

This data transaction enables a [=Transport Operator=] to exchange [=Transport Activity Data=] 
with a [=Transport Service Organizer=] or a [=Transport Service User=].

For this, the [=Transport Operator=] MUST

1. first collect Transport Activity Data necessary to calculate of a <{TAD}> (see [[#dt-tad]]) for each [=consignment=] identified by a [=consignment id=]
2. make the resulting <{TAD}> available through the Pathfinder Network API

The [=Transport Service Organizer=] or a [=Transport Service User=] CAN then retrieve the <{TAD|TADs}> using the [=consignment ids=].


# End-to-End Examples # {#examples}

Issue: create an end-to-end example combining Transction 1 and Transaction 2 to show how a shipper can gain transparency at the level of shipments and at the level of TCEs


# Data Model # {#data-model}

## Logistics Service Footprint (LSF) ## {#dt-lsf}

Issue: we need to find a better term! (candidate: shipment footprint)

A logistics service footprint (<def>LSF</def>) enables a [=Transport Service User=] to calculate the logistics emissions of a single shipment.

For this, the [=Transport Operator=] or [=Transport Service Organizer=] MUST 
- first calculate <{TCE|TCEs}> for a single shipment in accordance with [[#dt-tce]],
- and then derives the <{LSF}> from the <{TCE|TCEs}>.

Issue: this section needs additional refinement and specifications

### Data Attributes ### {#lsf-attributes}

A logistics service footprint (LSF) contains the following attributes (<dfn element>LSF</dfn>),
stored in the data model extension property `extensions` of the underlying `ProductFootprint`:

## Transport Operation Category ( <dfn element>TOC</dfn> ) ## {#dt-toc}

The Data Type <{TOC}> contains [=transport operation category=] data. It is referenced in a [=TCE=] through the <{TCE/tocId}> property.

The [=Transport Operator=] or [=Transport Service Organizer=] MUST calculate the <{TOC}> in accordance with the [[!GLEC]] Framework.

The [=Transport Operator=] or [=Transport Service Organizer=] CAN then make the <{TOC}> available through the Pathfinder Network API as a `ProductFootprint` (see [[#toc-mapping]]).

## Hub Operation Category ( <dfn element>HOC</dfn> ) ## {#dt-hoc}

Advisement: This section and data model requires significant input from the SFC Community

The Data Type <{HOC}> contains [=HOC=] data. It is referenced in a [=TCE=] through the <{TCE/hocId}> property.

[=HOCs=] are the building blocks for the calculation of a [=TCE=].

### Mapping to Pathfinder Data Model ### {#hoc-mapping}

## Transport Activity Data (<dfn element>TAD</dfn>) ## {#dt-tad}

<dfn>Transport Activity Data</dfn> contains [=transport activity data=]-level data relating to transport or
hub operations activities.

Transport Activity Data can be obtained from direct measurement
(see `primary data` definition of [[!ISO14083]]) or other measurements
(see `secondary data` definition of [[!ISO14083]]) such as modelled data
or default value.


### Data Attributes ### {#tad-attributes}

Note:
    the <{TAD}> data type is defined for the exchange of (primary) activity data for
    which no GHG emission or GHG entisities values have been calculated.

Properties of data type <{TAD}>:

Issue: this needs to be discussed with SFC and especially also Tool providers:
