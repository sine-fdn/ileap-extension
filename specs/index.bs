Abstract: This document outlines the semantics for logistics emissions data exchange as part of the SFC iLEAP Project. Its format is based on the PACT Technical Specifications and supports the integration of Logistics Emissions Data Exchange into the PACT Network. Implementing this specification enables stakeholders within the supply chain to exchange data on logistics emissions. This facilitates the tracking of logistics emissions and the computation of their contribution to product carbon footprints.

# Introduction # {#introduction}

- Companies want to move from generic and modeled data to primary environmental impact data that accurately reflects their supply chains.
- The standard PACT data model does not include fields of sufficient granularity for the agri-food industry.
- This document specifies a PACT [[#data-model]] extension and the relevant [=data transactions=].
- It includes mandatory additional fields from the [HESTIA](https://hestia.earth/schema) data model in order to meet these criteria.
- In addition it includes further optional reference fields to include agricultural activity data (data on inputs, products, practices, and site measurements) from HESTIA, which would provide the level of detail required to assess potential interventions and decarbonisation opportunities, as well as to recalculate impacts.
- Adoption of this specification enables the exchange of data between different actors in the agriculture value chain at a sufficient level of granularity to accurately reflect supply chain emissions and support facilitate interventions.


# Data Model # {#data-model}

The iLEAP data model of this chapter together with the data transactions ([[#txns]]) build on top of the [[!ISO14083|ISO 14083]] concepts of TOC, HOC, TCE, TC.

Additionally, the concept of transport activity data ([[#dt-tad|TAD]]) is added to facilitate reporting in case of missing data or limited emissions calculation capabilities from e.g. [=Transport Operators=].

Please, find more details on emissions calculation and the relantionship between the different concepts in the [[!GLEC]] Framework and [[!ISO14083]]).

The iLEAP Data Model is composed by five main data types: <{ShipmentFootprint}>, <{TCE}>, <{TOC}>,
<{HOC}>, and <{TAD}>.

<{ShipmentFootprint|ShipmentFootprints}> and <{TOC|TOCs}> can be exchanged independently as extensions to the PACT
Data Model ([[!PACTDX]]) (see [[!DATA-MODEL-EXTENSIONS]]) in a `ProductFootprint`.

<{TAD|TADs}> can be exchanged through a dedicated endpoint. These should only be used by [=Transport
Operators=] who cannot yet provide <{ShipmentFootprint|ShipmentFootprints}>, <{TOC|TOCs}>, nor <{HOC|HOCs}>.

## ShipmentFootprint ## {#dt-sf}

<dfn element>ShipmentFootprint</dfn> is a collection of 1
or more [=Transport Chain Elements=] (encoded as <{TCE|TCEs}>)
for a single [=shipment=] and from a single entity (a [=Transport Operator=] or a [=Transport Service Organizer=]).

By collecting 1 or more <{TCE|TCEs}> for a shipment from [=Transport Operators=] and [=Transport Service Organizer=],
a [=Transport Service User=] can construct the <{ShipmentFootprint}>. The <{ShipmentFootprint}> corresponds to the logistics emissions related to a full Transport Chain ([=TC=]).

To calculate a ShipmentFootprint, the [=Transport Service User=] MUST

- first receive <{TCE|TCEs}>  from [=Transport Operators=] and [=Transport Service Organizers=], linked to the shipment ID for a single shipment in accordance with [[#dt-tce]],
    OR calculate <{TCE|TCEs}> from <{TOC|TOCs}> or <{TAD|TADs}> from [=Transport Operators=] and [=Transport Service Organizers=].
- and then add up all <{TCE|TCEs}> that compose the full Transport Chain ([=TC=]) to derive the <{ShipmentFootprint}>.


### Data Attributes ### {#sf-attributes}

A <{ShipmentFootprint}> has the following properties:

## Transport Activity Data (<dfn element>TAD</dfn>) ## {#dt-tad}

The <dfn>Transport Activity Data‚ÄØ</dfn> (<{TAD}>) data type contains activity
data, referring to a single consignment, leg, and mode of transport, or to a
single transshipment within a hub.

Each TAD CAN contain values for attributes which are categorial to the
operations of a fleet or hub (such as load factor or mix of feedstock(s)).
In this case, the values CAN be calculated from the actual data of more
than one consignment (‚Äúrepresentative‚Äù or ‚Äúaverage data‚Äù).

<div class=example>
  Instead of exchanging the load factor for a single assignment,
  the load factor can be calculated from a multitude of consignments
  following the principles of TOC calculation.
</div>

The TAD data type is designed for entities
([=Transport Operators=] or [=Transport Service Organizers=]) that lack
the capabilities to perform carbon emission calculations
(see [[#business-case-3|Business Case 3]]) or are
contractually obliged to exchange activity data with another party.

It can also be used by the service providers (Transport Operator or
Transport Service Organizer) to provide additional transparency
to their business partners where relevant.

### Data Attributes ### {#tad-attributes}

Below table lists the properties defined for the <{TAD}> data type.

When exchanging it through the Action TransportActivityData, it MUST be
encoded as a JSON object. See [[#action-tad]] for details.

### Data Type <dfn>Decimal</dfn> ### {#dt-decimal}

A decimal number.

In JSON, a [=Decimal=] MUST be encoded as a JSON String.

Note: the JSON String encoding is necessary to avoid floating point rounding errors.


<div class=example>
  Example of the decimal numbers `10` and `-0.123` encoded in JSON:

  ```json
  "10"
  ```

  ```json
  "-0.123"
  ```
</div>

### Data Type <dfn>EnergyCarrier</dfn> ### {#dt-energy-carrier}

Data type `EnergyCarrier` represents an energy carrier, including its feedstocks.

In JSON an `EnergyCarrier` MUST be encoded as a JSON Object.

The following properties are defined for data type <dfn element>EnergyCarrier</dfn>:

            Possible values are:

            Advisement: The enumeration of energy consumption units will be evolved in future revisions.
            Account for this when implementing the validation of this property.
