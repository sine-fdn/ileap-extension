Abstract: This document outlines the semantics for logistics emissions data exchange as part of the SFC iLEAP Project. Its format is based on the PACT Technical Specifications and supports the integration of Logistics Emissions Data Exchange into the PACT Network. Implementing this specification enables stakeholders within the supply chain to exchange data on logistics emissions. This facilitates the tracking of logistics emissions and the computation of their contribution to product carbon footprints.

# Introduction # {#introduction}

- Companies want to move from generic and modeled data to primary environmental impact data that accurately reflects their supply chains.
- The standard PACT data model does not include fields of sufficient granularity for the agri-food industry.
- This document specifies a PACT data model extension and the relevant [=data transactions=].
- It includes mandatory additional fields from the [HESTIA](https://hestia.earth/schema) data model in order to meet these criteria.
- In addition it includes further optional reference fields to include agricultural activity data (data on inputs, products, practices, and site measurements) from HESTIA, which would provide the level of detail required to assess potential interventions and decarbonisation opportunities, as well as to recalculate impacts.
- Adoption of this specification enables the exchange of data between different actors in the agriculture value chain at a sufficient level of granularity to accurately reflect supply chain emissions and support facilitate interventions.
